# Top 10 List of Week 01

1. [Bash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell))<br>
Bash is a command processor that typically runs in a text window where the user types commands that cause actions. Bash can also
read and execute commands from a file, called a shell script. Like all Unix shells, it supports filename globbing (wildcard
matching), piping, here documents, command substitution, variables, and control structures for condition-testing and iteration.
The keywords, syntax, dynamically scoped variables and other basic features of the language are all copied from sh. Other
features (e.g., history), are copied from csh and ksh. Bash is a POSIX-compliant shell, but with a number of extensions. It was released in 1989, it has been used as the default login shell for most Linux distributions (e.g., Debian and Ubuntu.)

2. [GNU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU)<br>
GNU is an extensive collection of free software, which can be used as an operating system or can be used in parts with other 
operating systems. The use of the completed GNU tools led to the family of operating systems popularly known as Linux. Most of 
GNU is licensed under the GNU Project's own General Public License (GPL).

3. [Git](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git)<br>
Git is software for tracking changes in any set of files, usually used for coordinating work among programmers collaboratively 
developing source code during software development. Its goals include speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, 
non-linear workflows (thousands of parallel branches running on different systems). It was created by Linus Torvald in 2005.
